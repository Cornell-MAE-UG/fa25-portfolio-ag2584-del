## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University (’28) based in Ithaca. I’m part of Cornell Baja Racing’s Suspension subteam, where we design and iterate on off-road handling systems—linkages, steering components, and the overall suspension package—to build a durable vehicle that performs on rough terrain. I’m drawn to hands-on engineering that blends analysis with fabrication, and I’m always looking for projects where tight constraints and real testing drive better design
